This is my first website, and I created it to practice HTML and CSS. It’s a small restaurant-themed page where I tried different sections like a menu, gallery, and contact form.
I used images and simple designs to learn how layouts, navigation, and styling work. 
It’s not perfect, but it helped me understand the basics of building a website.
